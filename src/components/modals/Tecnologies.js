                According to the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA),
                while vanilla still remains the most popular ice cream flavour
                (with 27.8% market share in the US), the demand for chocolate
                ice cream is on the increase, moving from 10.4% in popularly in
                2008 to 14.3% in 2009. Interest in natural and Fairtrade
                products also continues to increase, so many companies
                incorporating these elements into their products are seeing
                growth despite fierce competition and the economic climate.

                        Consumer demand for ice cream made from natural
                        ingredients could be one of the reasons why Nigel
                        Langstone, co-founder of Joe Delucci’s, is seeing an
                        increase in sales – despite initially struggling to
                        impact a market that has traditionally been dominated by
                        big established brands.

                    <TechnologiesText>
                        In 2008, a Business Insights study stated that 81.4% of
                        respondents believed “flavours from natural ingredients”
                        would be the most important trend from 2008 to 2012.

                “We didn’t start by thinking we’ll do a natural product, gelato
                has always been made like this in Italy,” said Langstone. “We’re
                fresh and natural, and I can’t say if that’s the reason behind
                our increasing our sales, but they certainly are increasing
                because we keep opening more shops.”

                His best-selling flavours are chocolate, vanilla and strawberry,
                which make up 70% of sales, but the shops sell a range of 24
                different flavours, “all of which sell really well”.
            </TechnologiesText>
            <TechnologiesText>
                Once consumers are persuaded to try gelato (some consumers used
                to be suspicious of its contents, thinking it contained
                gelatine), they are “very surprised” at how natural it tastes.
            </TechnologiesText>
            <TechnologiesText>
                “We often have to convince people and wholesalers to try it, but
                once they do they are amazed and say they wish they’d known
                about it before,” said Langstone. The company’s tagline is
                ‘Remarkable Italian Ice Cream‘, just to make it clear to those
                who are not familiar with the term gelato.

                The secret behind top chocolate flavours
            </TechnologiesTitle>
            <TechnologiesText>
                Langstone has found there is a trend, among smaller companies,
                towards using premade pastes that are mixed with both artificial
                and natural flavours.
            </TechnologiesText>
            <TechnologiesText>
                “To my palate it tastes a bit too industrial, so we prefer to
                use natural ingredients wherever possible,” he said. “In our
                chocolate ice cream we prefer to use cocoa mass from Ecuador
                (South American chocolate has a more distinct taste) and unlike
                a lot of gelato we use milk in our milk chocolate ice cream.”
            </TechnologiesText>
            <TechnologiesText>
                The milk chocolate flavour from Joe Delucci’s contains 9-10%
                chocolate. The dark chocolate variety uses 23-24% chocolate,
                which is made with water, so it does not contain any dairy at
                all. “This gives it a really intense chocolate taste,” said
                Langstone.

                So what about the ‘chocky-hazelnutty deliciousness’ flavour,
                what kind of ingredients can consumers expect to find in this
                product? “This contains exactly the same as the chocolate
                gelato, but it is mixed with the hazelnut gelato, which includes
                milk, sugar, cream and natural hazelnut paste – by paste I just
                mean hazelnuts ground down and mixed with their own oil.
                Ingredients-wise it is as natural as you can get.”

                        chief executive, said in a letter to the CSPI “that
                        although he believed ‘reasonable customers’ would still
                        consider Ben & Jerry’s food to be natural, he did not
                        want any further questions over the issue”.

                He is also reported to have written that the company intended to
                “focus more strongly on other core values such as Fairtrade
                suppliers, cage-free eggs and milk from dairy farms that to do

                “The Fairtrade model is one that helps us and help farmers in
                third world countries,” said Sean Greenwood of Ben & Jerry’s.
                “We’ve been trying for three decades now to incorporate these
                values throughout our business practice.”

                In February 2010 Ben & Jerry’s announced its commitment to
                incorporate Fairtrade ingredients across its whole flavour
                portfolio by the end of 2013. Consumer demand for Fairtrade
                products is on the increase across the globe, but particularly
                in the UK.

                Earlier in 2011 the Fairtrade Foundation announced sales of

                retail value of £1.17bn, compared with £836m in 2009.

                Taste trips of a lifetime – staying on top of consumer demand
            </TechnologiesTitle>
            <TechnologiesText>
                When it comes to creating chocolate flavours for its ice cream
                range, Ben & Jerry’s taste team ensure that when they are on
                ‘taste trips’ and come across appealing chocolate flavours that
                they talk to the suppliers about where their chocolate comes
                from. This happened recently when Peter Lind, the primal ice
                cream therapist for Ben & Jerry’s R&D department, sampled
                chocolate ice cream on a taste trip to San Francisco.
            </TechnologiesText>
            <TechnologiesText>
                “In San Francisco we went to a chocolate supplier and tried a
                number of their chocolates that might work in ice cream,” said
                Lind.
            </TechnologiesText>
            <TechnologiesText>
                “We talked to them about how they got this chocolate and how
                they work with their growers.” He added: “There’s a lot of
                education involved in how to get a uniform product. Good
                suppliers work with growers and if they get good beans from a
                particular farmer they then share the best practices with the
                other farmers.”

                Ben & Jerry’s ice cream products are renowned for their unusual
                flavour names and combinations. The company is also known for
                pulling flavours from its range, making way for new ones to hit
                the flavour zeitgeist of consumer demand. The R&D team regularly
                take taste trips and earlier in 2011 they had planned to visit
                San Francisco and then LA, but after three days in San Francisco
                they had found so many new flavours they didn’t need to search
                any further.
            </TechnologiesText>
            <TechnologiesText>
                “We tasted about 50 different ice cream, gelato or frozen
                yoghurt flavours each day in San Francisco,” said Lind.

                        “Sometimes it was very quick and we’d go into a shop and
                        order maybe ten flavours, but a number of times we
                        stayed longer. There was one place where we tried 40
                        different frozen desserts in two hours.”

                    <TechnologiesText>
                        Another way the team stay on top of consumer demand is
                        by evaluating consumer suggestions. “We compile a list
                        of 25-30 ideas and then divide them between the five of
                        us in R&D and then try them out for taste.” The process
                        takes about six weeks and at the end about ten flavours
                        are carried forward for more detailed research.

            <TechnologiesText>
                A new flavour ice cream would finally be decided upon by a
                consumer test itself. “From the 200 initial ideas from the taste
                trip and consumer suggestions, we gradually work these down to
                two or three flavours, following an in-house evaluation, which
                are then tested by about 200 consumers for feedback.”
            </TechnologiesText>
            <TechnologiesText>
                So what are Lind’s suggestions for upcoming chocolate ice cream
                flavour trends? “In San Francisco we tried a lot of ice cream
                containing herbs: sage with blackberry, rosemary, lime with
                basil, and I think we’ll see more accents of this type coming
                up,” he said.
            </TechnologiesText>
            <TechnologiesText>
                “Also, we already have tea in chocolate, but we will see more of
                that, as well as spicy ingredients, such as chilli chocolate and
                ginger chocolate.”
